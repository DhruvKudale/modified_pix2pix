# About Project

With the exponential growth of technology and digital media, images have
started playing a critical role in our day-to-day lives and cutting-edge research fields like Biology and Astronomy. Clear images are a prime requirement in a variety of fields ranging from the study of microscopic details to the purpose of crime investigation. However, images prove to be useful only when they can successfully convey information to a viewer. Images are prone to loss of clarity due to many reasons including camera shake, movement of the subject, inaccurate focusing, and so on due to which they become less distinct. Blurred images lack clarity as the decreased clarity makes it difficult for viewers to figure out the intricate details
in the images. As a result, for enhances the visual quality and extracting
useful data, deblurring is the need of the hour. Through this project, we have attempted to develop a generic solution to deblur images affected by uniform motion blur and uniform focus blur which are two of the most common naturally occurring types of blurs. Apart from being the first of its kind in providing a single solution that deals with multiple types of blur, our work has shown to be the best amongst its recent competitors in terms of the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio metric and the precision factor of the newly introduced and developing Object Detection metric.

# Deblurring GAN using pix2pix in PyTorch

We provide PyTorch implementations for both unpaired and paired image-to-image translation.

The code was written by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://github.com/junyanz) and [Taesung Park](https://github.com/taesung), and supported by [Tongzhou Wang](https://ssnl.github.io/).

This PyTorch implementation produces results comparable to or better than our original Torch software. If you would like to reproduce the same results as in the papers, check out the original [CycleGAN Torch](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) and [pix2pix Torch](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) code


You may find useful information in [training/test tips](docs/tips.md) and [frequently asked questions](docs/qa.md). To implement custom models and datasets, check out our [templates](#custom-model-and-dataset). To help users better understand and adapt our codebase, we provide an [overview](docs/overview.md) of the code structure of this repository.

### pix2pix train/test
- Download a pix2pix dataset (e.g.[facades](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/)):
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades
```
- To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097.
- Train a model:
```bash
#!./scripts/train_pix2pix.sh
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA
```
To see more intermediate results, check out  `./checkpoints/facades_pix2pix/web/index.html`.

- Test the model (`bash ./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh`):
```bash
#!./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA
```
- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/facades_pix2pix/test_latest/index.html`. You can find more scripts at `scripts` directory.
- To train and test pix2pix-based colorization models, please add `--model colorization` and `--dataset_mode colorization`. See our training [tips](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/docs/tips.md#notes-on-colorization) for more details.


### Apply a pre-trained model (pix2pix)
Download a pre-trained model with `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`.

- Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh#L3) for all the available pix2pix models. For example, if you would like to download label2photo model on the Facades dataset,
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh facades_label2photo
```
- Download the pix2pix facades datasets:
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades
```
- Then generate the results using
```bash
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades/ --direction BtoA --model pix2pix --name facades_label2photo_pretrained
```
- Note that we specified `--direction BtoA` as Facades dataset's A to B direction is photos to labels.

- If you would like to apply a pre-trained model to a collection of input images (rather than image pairs), please use `--model test` option. See `./scripts/test_single.sh` for how to apply a model to Facade label maps (stored in the directory `facades/testB`).

- See a list of currently available models at `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`
